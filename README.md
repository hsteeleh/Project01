Project 01: Global Grooves

No matter who you are or who you’re with, you’ll want something fun to do and you’ll want an app to help you find and locate music events nearby.  Global Grooves helps you do just that, with an interactive map and a search tool to help you find your favorite music artist. 

We created Global Grooves to make sure people like you can know who is playing and where at your convenience. 

Jon and Arturo worked on the map Function.

Sarah and Hannah worked on front end design, loading the table, getting the "Tickets" links to work.
