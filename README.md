Project 01: Global Grooves

Global Grooves helps travelers find fun events wherever they are based on location or event.  This application can help find events in the future for those who prefer planning, or find events right now for those who are more spontaneous. 

During the team brainstorm session, we noticed some of us were interested in music and others were interested in travel.  We thought combining these two interest would make a fun and useful application for a variety of people. 

Arturo, Jon, Hannah, and Sarah collaborated to create Global Grooves.
